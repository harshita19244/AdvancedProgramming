This repository is solely for future reference, doesn't aim to infringe. 
 
This repository contains a list a Java micro-projects each of which has been implemented using object-oriented programming. These micro projects also utlize threads for concurrent program execution. The repository includes the following set of java micro projects:

⭐️Food Delivery Application: </br>
This Java application is the backend implementation of a food delivery system. It serves as an interface for restaurants to register their menus, collect orders, provide discounts to customers and customers to register themselves, avail discounts and order a variety of dishes from various restaurants registered on the platform. Hence this application serves as a bridge between the consumers and the business owners.It utilizes object-oriented programming and event-driven programming in Java. </br>


⭐️Hospital Management System: </br>
This application aims to simplify the procedure of admitting patients in hospitals on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. It analyses the patient’s health status to onboard new patients in the registered hospitals based on the availability of beds and vital care facilities. It utilizes object-oriented programming and threads in Java for parallel processing, updation of status and proper admission. </br>


⭐️Mafia Game: </br>
The above application is a logical backend implementation of the famous party game: Mafia. It utilizes design patterns, thread-pool setting and object oriented programming to achieve the necessary results. The game randomly allocates the roles of a Mafia, Healer, Commoner and Detective to a set of registered players. It then utilizes user inputs and randomization techniques to decide which players to kill, save and heal, ensuring a smooth gameplay. </br>


⭐️Tree Traversal : </br>
This application is the implementation of a recursive tree traversal algorithm done using threads, to compare its performance over a normal recursive algorithm by measuring its overall efficiency. </br>
